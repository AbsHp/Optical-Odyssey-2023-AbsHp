The main aim of the project is to build our own James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) twin. 
For this purpose, we get a basic intro to the working of various land and space telescopes and understand the working of different equipments and processing dataset from JWST. 
We then learn multiple mirror optics and conditions in space by building a light collector similar to that of the primary mirror of the JWST. 
The light collector is illuminated using a heat lamp, and the intensity of light reflected from the mirrors is measured from behind a protective “sunshield”. 
The observations are recorded and the data is analysed. 
Then, we construct a set up similar to the JWST (Mini-JWST Twin) and from the data we take from this set up, we are able to calculate the efficiency of sunshield.
